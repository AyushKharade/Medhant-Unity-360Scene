# Medhant Unity 360Scene
 
Hey,

Open the project in Unity.

If you need to make any lighting changes.
Rotate the directional light in the scene. Just like maya, based on the rotation angle of the light, it will simulate the sunlight.

Let me know if you need help with anything.

I have put an empty script on the camera object.
If you plan to code the camera movements, you can just edit the camera script i have put in Scripts folders.
